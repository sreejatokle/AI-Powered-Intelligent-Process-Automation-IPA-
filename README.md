Project Overview
AI-Powered Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) aims to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks across various business processes, including data entry, document processing, customer service interactions, and more. By leveraging AI, Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), this solution enhances productivity, reduces costs, and amplifies human potential within organizations.

Key Features
OCR for Data Extraction: Extracts text from documents and images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Document Classification with NLP: Classifies text extracted from documents using NLP for automated categorization.
Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Automates workflows and repetitive tasks to reduce manual intervention.
AI-Powered Chatbot: Provides 24/7 customer support with a conversational AI bot.
Cloud Integration: Uses cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) for scalability and secure document storage.
Database Integration: Stores processed data and automation results in a PostgreSQL database.
Security: Implements OAuth 2.0 for authentication and AES encryption for secure data handling.
Technologies Used
Python: For backend, NLP, and RPA scripting.
Tesseract OCR: For Optical Character Recognition.
HuggingFace Transformers: For NLP-based document classification.
PyAutoGUI: For simulating RPA actions.
FastAPI: For developing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: For structured data storage.
AWS (S3, Lambda): For cloud-based storage and serverless computing.
OpenAI GPT-3/4: For AI-driven chatbot functionality.
OAuth 2.0: For secure authentication.
Installation Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
AWS Account (if using AWS services)
OpenAI API Key (for GPT-3/4)
PostgreSQL Database (for storing processed data)
Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ipa-project.git
cd ai-ipa-project
Step 2: Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Set up environment variables
AWS Credentials (for S3 and Lambda): Set up using the AWS CLI or manually.
OpenAI API Key: Set up an account at OpenAI and add your key in the environment variables.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your-aws-access-key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your-aws-secret-key'
Step 4: Run the backend API
Start the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
You can now access the API at http://localhost:8000.

Step 5: Cloud Services Setup
AWS S3: Set up an S3 bucket to store documents.
AWS Lambda: Create Lambda functions for serverless execution if needed.
Usage
OCR Endpoint: Use this endpoint to extract text from an image.

Endpoint: /process-image/
Method: POST
Body: {"image_path": "path_to_image"}
Response: JSON with extracted text.
Chatbot Endpoint: Use this endpoint to interact with the AI-powered chatbot.

Endpoint: /chatbot/
Method: POST
Body: {"user_input": "How can I reset my password?"}
Response: JSON with chatbot's response.
Database Integration: Use the PostgreSQL setup to query and store processed data.

Security Considerations
All sensitive data should be stored securely using encryption techniques like AES.
Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.
Follow data privacy regulations like GDPR when handling personal data.
